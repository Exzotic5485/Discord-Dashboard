# Creating Project Instance

Discord-Dashboard is a module that needs a permanent connection to your ACS (Assistants Center Services) account. 

**Why?**

Because we care about your satisfaction, the module has several systems that need authorisation with our external system. These include, for example, your project statistics and the project licensing system.

- Statistics is a summary of your project activity that only you can access whenever you want. Statistics only work in production mode, so dev mode does not send statistics.
- Project licensing is about to identify whether you have a Premium Plan to unlock specially developed modules, addons and much more! [Learn more about Premium Plan.](https://assistantscenter.com/discord-dashboard)
